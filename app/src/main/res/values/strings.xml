These times are known as Makruh Tahrimi, and it is discouraged to offer prayers during these periods. The three forbidden times are:\n\n1. The time of Sunrise (Fajr):\nThis is the time period between the pre-dawn prayer (Fajr) and sunrise. Researchers found that it takes 12-15 minutes to disappear the yellow light after sunrise.\n\n2. The time of Zawaal (Dhuhr):\nThis is the time when the sun is at its highest point in the sky, around midday. It starts right after the sun has crossed the zenith point until it starts declining. In Arabic, the time is called Zawaal. According to Islamic scholars, 6 minutes before the Dhuhr (midday) prayer haram time to pray salat.\n\n3. The time of Sunset (Maghrib):\nWhile the Sun starts to take a yellowish color before sunset, the time is forbidden for any salat. Research finds that it usually takes 15 minutes before Maghrib. So, this 15 minutes is the haram time for prayer.\n\nHowever, if anyone misses Asr prayer, in case he/she starts praying before sunset and the prayer continues while sunset, the prayer will be granted.</string>
